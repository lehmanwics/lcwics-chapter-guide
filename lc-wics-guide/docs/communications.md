The chapter communicates with its members via the following channels:

## <span style="color:orange">Social Media</span>

The chapter has the following social media accounts:

1. Twitter | @lcwics | [https://twitter.com/lcwics](https://twitter.com/lcwics)  
2. Instagram | @lcwics | [https://instagram.com/lcwics/](https://instagram.com/lcwics/)
3. Facebook | @lcwics | [http://facebook.com/lcwics](http://facebook.com/lcwics)

Authentication for Twitter and Instagram accounts are stored in **LastPass**. Access each account by logging into LastPass with the proper credentials. 
Facebook requires a **current admin** in the FB group to add you to the page.

### *Managing Multiple Social Media Accounts*

To facitilate multi-channel posting and make life easier, install the **[Buffer](https://buffer.com/signin)** app on your mobile device or [log in online](https://buffer.com/signin) using the lcwics Twitter credentials.

With **Buffer**, you can cross-post on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram once and the same post will appear on all channels.

### *Posting Frequency*
Posting frequency is up to the Communications Chair in agreement with the executive board. Ideally, posting to announce events and post-event recaps and photos are highly suggested to keep members and followers up-to-date.

## <span style="color:orange">Slack</span>

The chapter uses Slack chat for real-time communication with members, advisors, and executive board:

* [lehmanwics.slack.com](lehmanwics.slack.com)

Ask a current board member to send you the invite link to our Slack or find it in [bit.ly](bit.ly) by accessing the credentials via **LastPass**. A current board member should add you to the private e-board chat and make you an admin in the workspace. 

Admins can manage settings, integrations, and membership for the Slack workspace. 

Important items can be pinned to a channel and will stay pinned forever.

**<span style="color:blue">Make sure to remove admin privileges at the end of each semester as board members leave.</span>**

### *Important Channels*

New members are automatically added to the *general, opportunities, events, and _announcements* channels. The channels are used as follows:

* *general* : Posting general content to share with members, news, clips, reposts from other channels, etc.
* *opportunities* : Posting internships, jobs, resources for interviewing, and anything else that could help lead to an opportunity
* *events* : Posting upcoming events (preference for women-focused, women-led events)
* *_announcements* : Posting important notifications for all members. Use @everyone to notify everyone in the workspace

## <span style="color:orange">Website Chat</span>

The chapter uses an integrated chat bot on our [website](lehmanwics.github.io) to communicate with anyone who is on our website and has questions. 

The service used for this chat bot is called **[smallchat](https://small.chat/)** and is an app connected to a private Slack channel called: **#lcwics_site_chat**

The Communications chair is responsible for responding to chat conversations on the website as soon as possible.

## <span style="color:orange">Email</span>

The chapter uses the following email services:

1. [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/)
2. Gmail | lehmanwics@gmail.com

To log into *Mailchimp*, access the credentials via **LastPass**. The *Gmail* login is to be provided to you by current or previous board members.

**Mailchimp is used to send announcements, newsletters, meeting notes, and event reminders to our members. Gmail is used to communicate with members who contact us directly, respond to emails, communicate with advisors and faculty, as well as communicate with sponsors.**

### *Sharing Mailbox*

The Gmail inbox is currently shared amongst all board members. If a member needs to be contacted or replied to directly, the email should be prefixed with their title and name. 

Example: *@COMM/Keri - "Email subject here"*

This allows for the correct board member to review an email. For all **new** emails that come into the inbox without direction, the Comm chair will respond and maintain contact until the end of the thread or a new thread begins.

Once an email thread is completed or has ended and no further communication is necessary, please archive the email.

### *Member Communication*

The Google Form titled *"Lehman WiCS Welcome Form"* is connected to Mailchimp service via Zapier as a zap called "Welcome Form to MailChimp Connection". 

When someone signs up using the Google Form, an action is fired off to Zapier and the new member is automatically added to Mailchimp List called *"Lehman WiCS"*. Once the new member is added, a welcome email titled 'Welcome Message' under *Campaigns* is sent to the user.

<span style="color:blue">This Welcome email should be reviewed and edited at the beginning of each semester to maintain accurate information.</span>

<span style="color:red">**Do not manually add any members to this list as it could corrupt the connection.**</span>


### *Faculty/Advisor Communication*

Faculty and advisors <span style="color:red">should not</span> be emailed directly via Mailchimp. All faculty, staff, and advisors should be emailed directly from our Gmail mailbox.
