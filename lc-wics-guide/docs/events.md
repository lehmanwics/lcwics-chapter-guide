Events for the chapter are stored under the **"Events"** folder in Google Drive. A list of possible activities to consider for events is also available in that folder.

Events must be pre-approved and previously agreed upon by the board. 

*It is suggested that the board collectively comes up with an event title, flyer, and description **before** submitting an event to make the process quicker.*

Catering pamphlets for Lehman College are on Campus Link and the Google Drive.

If using sponsorship funds for food instead, confirm the food request **a week** before the event and again **2 hours** before the event. See the [Finances](finances.md) section for more information on keeping proper financial records for food requests.

## <span style="color: orange">*Flyers*</span>

Flyers should be disbursed around campus at least 2 weeks in advance, with 3-4 weeks being optimal. Use Canva(services.md#canva) to create your flyer and save to the Google Drive.

## <span style="color: orange">*Promotion*</span>

There are several channels available for event promotion:

- Mailchimp
- Slack
- College chairs/faculty
- Meetings
- In-Class Promotion

Use Mailchimp to send out meeting announcements at least 2-3 weeks before the event via newsletter. Send a reminder on the day-of in the morning (schedule the email).

Announce the event on Slack as soon as possible and add the event to the LC WiCS Calendar. Post a reminder a day before and a couple of hours before the event on Slack.

Send an email a week before the event to CUNY college department chairs and Lehman faculty politely asking to share details with their students. Include the flyer, date, time, and location.

Announce and remind members during meetings that the event is coming up.

Email professors asking for permission to promote in their classes. For bigger turnout, choose lower-level CMP courses and higher-level electives. Consider cross-promoting and/or co-sponsoring with NSBE/SHPE and/or ALPFA or other CUNY clubs for larger turnout.
