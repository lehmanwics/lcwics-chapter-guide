Once you're logged in, click **Posts** from the left-hand side to view all published and unpublished/draft posts. 

To create a new post, click the **Add New** green button on the top of the page. On the left you will see some fields which are called "front matter". This is what allows the website to display stylized posts.

Make sure to fill in the fields as follows:

1. LAYOUT - **leave as "post"** 
2. TITLE - title of post
3. TAGLINE - a brief description of the post
4. TAGS - tags to group posts by content type (e.g. opportunities, events)
5. IMG - upload an image that will appear as the face for the blog post
6. KEYWORDS - keywords relevant to the post (e.g. blockchain, data science, business analyst)
7. BGCOLOR - this is the background color for the preview of the post. **leave as is**

On the right-hand side, you will type in your post. ** To cut off the post, insert `<!-- more -->` beneath the line you want to leave above the fold. **

Click **Save** at the top-right to save your changes and make sure to click **Publish** to make the post public.

*Changes may take 5 minutes to appear on the website.*
