<p>WiCS meetings are open to any member of the Lehman community regardless of background (major, gender, year, etc). Any student who attends a WiCS meeting will automatically be considered a general member.</p>
<p><em>Meetings are usually held on Wednesdays from 4pm - 5pm.</em></p>
<p>Members earn points for every meeting attended. See the points structure in the <a href="../membership/"><strong>Membership</strong></a> section.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="general-meetings"><span style="color: orange"><em>General Meetings</em></span></h2>
<p><em>A sign-up sheet or form should be available for members to sign in to each meeting and record their attendance.</em></p>
<p>Communications chair is responsible for signing people in and keeping notes during the meeting, interrupting when needed to get clarification. Meeting notes should be available to chapter membership through the newsletter or brief reports at general meetings as well as in our Google Drive folder under <strong>Meetings</strong> &gt; <strong>General Meetings</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="meeting-structure">Meeting Structure</h3>
<ol>
<li>Each general meeting should begin with the Communications Chair calling order and outlining the agenda items. </li>
<li>The Chair or Vice Chair will continue the meeting by going over each item. </li>
<li>Before the close of the meeting, invite members to talk about any current opportunities they are working or any questions, comments they have.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>It is suggested that the last half of the meeting is designated to working on one easy/medium technical question and one behavioral question.</em> </p>
<p>At the end of the general meeting, the next meeting time and date should be announced as well as any important information/reminders. Additionally, the Communications Chair should add up any points for members and send an email to those not in our mailing list.</p>
<h3 id="special-meetings">Special Meetings</h3>
<p>Special meetings are those that do not follow a general meeting structure. These meetings fall on the same date and time as a general meeting are reserved for special topics or talks hosted by board members or invited student guests.</p>
<p>Example: GHC recap meeting</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="board-meetings"><span style="color: orange"><em>Board Meetings</em></span></h2>
<p><em>An agenda should be prepared before the board meeting and sent to all board members and advisors prior to the meeting</em>.</p>
<p>An invite and call info should be sent to all board members and advisors <strong>one week</strong> in advance.</p>
<p>Executive board meetings should be announced in advance to the chapter membership to encourage them to attend. An “open door” policy for executive board meetings encourages participation in chapter management, thus providing a pool of potential chapter leaders. </p>
<p><strong>It should be noted that only current board members can vote during board meetings.</strong> <strong> At least 3 board members must be present for voting to take place. There are no stand-ins for board members. </strong></p>
<p>Meeting notes should be recorded by the Communications Chair and added to the Google Drive after the board meeting. </p>
<h3 id="meeting-structure_1">Meeting Structure</h3>
<ol>
<li>Board meetings should begin with the Communications Chair calling attention and roll call. </li>
<li>They will move on to outlining agenda items and asking for any questions prior to start. </li>
<li>The Chair or Vice Chair will continue with the first agenda item after all questions are answered.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Communications Chair will keep everyone on track with time to keep the meeting moving forward and record notes during the meeting. </p>
<p>At the end of the board meeting, the next meeting time and date should be confirmed and scheduled.</p>
