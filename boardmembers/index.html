                <h1 id="executive-board">Executive Board</h1>
<p>"The chapter’s executive council is generally responsible for managing the chapter’s affairs (with the exception of electing officers and amending bylaws). It is essential for the executive council to be open to the suggestions and feedback of the chapter membership, and should always be open to offers of help. </p>
<p>Upon assuming the office, all chapter officers should contact the ACM Local Activities Coordinator to introduce him/herself, review chapter bylaws and policies and procedures, and review the events of the past year with his/her predecessors."</p>
<h2 id="executive-board-members">Executive Board Members</h2>
<p>The chapter consists of four executive board members:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chair/President</li>
<li>Vice-Chair/Vice President</li>
<li>Finance Chair/Treasurer</li>
<li>Communications Chair/Secretary</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Board members hold their positions for a maximum term of 1 academic year.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="roles-responsibilities">Roles &amp; Responsibilities</h2>
<h3 id="chair">Chair</h3>
<p>The chapter Chairperson has the overall responsibility for developing chapter programs, for ensuring that plans and assignments are carried out, and for seeing that the chapter fulfills its obligations to the Association. The Chairperson should be familiar with the policies and procedures of the Association, with the chapter’s bylaws, and with the duties of all the other chapter officers and committee chairpersons. </p>
<p>The newly-elected Chairperson should schedule an executive committee meeting which includes the outgoing officers as well. At that time, the Chairperson may want to schedule executive council meetings for the entire year. Keep in mind the advantages of scheduling the meeting at the same time each month. </p>
<p>Before getting too far along in the chapter’s year, the Chairperson should do the following: appoint or establish nominating committee according to bylaws for next year’s elections; communicate activities of the chapter to the local membership (many chapter chairpersons write a column in the chapter newsletter); set audit procedures in motion at year end for financial records turnover; and plan a budget with the chapter Treasurer, to be reviewed and approved by the entire executive council. </p>
<p>If the chapter’s area includes other local ACM groups, the Chairperson should contact the appropriate chairpersons and suggest a meeting. At the meeting, the chairpersons should discuss the possibilities for cooperative efforts, such as joint meetings, reciprocal advertising agreements, the sharing of membership lists, and planning of lecture tours. They should also discuss meeting times to ensure that one group’s meetings do not conflict with meetings of other ACM chapters in the area.</p>
<p>One of the most important duties of the chapter Chairperson is finding enthusiastic and qualified members to serve as committee chairpersons. The Chairperson should strive to bring new people into the committee structure to provide training for future chapter leaders. The job of chapter chairperson will be much more enjoyable and (much less exhausting) once responsible and reliable volunteers are found to take on various duties. It is strongly recommended that the chapter chairperson take the time at general meetings to acknowledge those chapter volunteers whose help has been valuable. This positive feedback and public recognition of good works is often just the encouragement an active volunteer needs to commit to a longer-term leadership position in the chapter in future years.</p>
<h3 id="vice-chair">Vice Chair</h3>
<p>The chapter Vice Chairperson should be prepared to assume the office of Chairperson or temporarily act in that position at any time. The Vice Chairperson should be familiar with the duties and responsibilities of the Chairperson, and of the other elected officers and committee chairpersons. </p>
<p>The Vice Chairperson can be an integral component of the chapter’s operation. In most cases, the Vice Chairperson is responsible for overseeing the activities and progress of the various committee and chapter programs. </p>
<h3 id="finance-chairtreasurer">Finance Chair/Treasurer</h3>
<p>The chapter’s financial management and operation are of great importance to the Association. The chapter Treasurer is responsible for the fiscal operation and reporting of the chapter, and of all committees and programs established by the chapter including sponsorships. </p>
<p>The ongoing responsibilities of the chapter treasurer include: 
1. Maintaining all chapter financial records and chapter checkbook;
2. Collecting money at meetings if applicable; 
3. Filing mandatory annual financial report with headquarters; 
4. Supplying appropriate budget report to the executive board of the chapter for all events; 
5. Reporting financial status to chapter; 
6. Maintain records of financial sponsorships;
7. Coordinating membership procedure and fee.</p>
<h3 id="communications-chair-secretary">Communications Chair/ Secretary</h3>
<p>The ongoing responsibilities of the Chapter Secretary include:<br />
1. Informing ACM Headquarters of the names and contact information of new officers and providing headquarters with updated membership lists;<br />
2. Sending agenda to board members for executive board meetings and recording the minutes of such meetings;<br />
3. Handling all chapter correspondence via email and additional appropriate channels on a timely basis;<br />
4. Maintaining chapter files for historical purposes;<br />
5. Corresponding with headquarters regarding changes to the chapter’s bylaws;<br />
6. Sending communications via appropriate channels to members and advisors.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="advisory-board">Advisory Board</h2>
<p>Our advisory board consists of four advisors:</p>
<ol>
<li>Faculty Advisors: Eva Sofianos, Steven Fulakeza</li>
<li>Industry Advisor: Iynna Halilou</li>
<li>Alumnae Advisor: Leslie Gil</li>
</ol>
<p>Our advisors graciouslty offer their expertise and time to guide the chapter through any questions and concerns they have as well as provide support when possible for strategy during the semester.</p>
<p>We invite our advisory board to all board meetings and provide updates after each meeting.</p>
<p>Specifically, faculty advisors shall be generally responsible for the activities of the Chapter. Specifically, they help provide continuity from year to year as student leadership and personnel change; promotes good student-faculty relationships; helps maintain university standards in all activities of the Chapter; and exercises financial supervision, if necessary, by promoting prompt payment of bills and collection of dues and overseeing the settlement of all accounts in the event of dissolution of the Chapter.</p>
<p>The faculty advisors are expected to communicate regular (at least monthly) with the chapter board and request business updates as needed.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>
<p>The executive board for this chapter communicates regularly via Slack in our private board channel. Each board member is responsible for responding to direct communication and any questions asked of the entire board.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="elections">Elections</h2>
<p>Elections are held on a yearly basis and at the end of semester (if necessary). Elections are to be hosted online via Campus Link. </p>
<p>Elections should be held one month before the semester ends and new board members should be announced at the closing final meeting. </p>
<p>Each member leaving their post should leave a transition guide letter detailing important information about their position, projects they were working on and left behind, as well as any other important information or advice that would be helpful for the new board member.</p>
<p><strong>Additionally, current board members should introduce the new board as soon as possible and in-person (if possible) to all advisors so they are aware of the transition.</strong></p>
