                <h1 id="planning-for-success">Planning for Success</h1>
<p>Each semester/year, the chapter will hold a planning meeting at least 3 weeks in advance of the semester/year beginning. This meeting will serve as a time for the board, advisors, and general members (if invited) to work together and create a plan for meetings, mixers, events, and fundraising for the semester/year.</p>
<p>The Communications Chair and Vice-Chair should work together prior to this meeting to create an agenda that includes the following items:</p>
<ol>
<li>Theme for the semester/year (optional but will help guide what type of events to host)</li>
<li>Goals for the semester/year</li>
<li>General meeting dates/times/location</li>
<li>Board meeting dates/times/location</li>
<li>Events for the semester/year</li>
<li>First welcome meeting &amp; Closing final meeting details</li>
<li>Timeline and action items for events</li>
<li>General funding needed for events</li>
<li>Sponsorship/fundraising</li>
<li>General flyer</li>
<li>GHC - Grace Hopper Celebration</li>
<li>Elections</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a general list and can be revised based on the needs of the chapter.</p>
<p><strong> A planning meeting usually runs between 3-5 hours. Please plan accordingly. Your agenda will help immensely. </strong></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="agenda-breakdown">Agenda Breakdown</h2>
<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>
<p><em>Time alloted: 10-15 mins</em></p>
<p>1-3 goals per semester is sufficient. Ideally, 2-3 goals if planning is for the entire year. 
Goals should be measurable so they can be easily tracked.</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><em>Poor goal</em>:</span> Gain more members
</br>
<span style="color: green"><em>Good goal</em>:</span> Gain at least 10 active members</p>
<p>Goals will also guide you in creating events for the semester/year in order to meet these goals. Make sure to put something a system in place to easily track your goals throughout the semester.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="choosing-general-meeting-dates">Choosing General Meeting Dates</h3>
<p><em>Time alloted: 5-10 mins</em></p>
<p>Meetings are generally run every Wednesday from 4pm - 5pm. Add holidays and days off from the CUNY calendar onto the chapter's Gmail calendar and work around them to create a calendar of meeting dates. </p>
<p>This information can also be added to the general meeting flyer.</p>
<p>For more information on general meetings, go to the <a href="../meetings/">meetings</a> section in this guide.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="choosing-board-meeting-dates">Choosing Board Meeting Dates</h3>
<p><em>Time alloted: 5-10 mins</em></p>
<p>Work with your board members to see which dates/times work best for board meetings. Generally, an hour before the club's meeting time is preferred and during club hours as most students will not have class during this time.</p>
<p>Add these dates to the Gmail calendar.</p>
<p>For more information on board meetings, go to the <a href="../meetings/">meetings</a> section in this guide.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="events-for-the-semesteryear">Events for the Semester/Year</h3>
<p><em>Time alloted: 30-60 mins</em></p>
<p>This is an important item that <strong>should not</strong> be skipped. Take time to think through events, mixers, panels, hackathons, workshops, and Tech Treks that will be valuable to your members and lead to a successful semester.</p>
<p>Also considering volunteering events, social mixers, and cool-off events to bring members together and hang out. </p>
<p><strong>You are required by Student Life to have <em>4 events</em> a semester so you must have a minimum of 4 events (of any type) scheduled.</strong>*</p>
<p>Review the most successful events in the past (see Google Drive) and have a flagship event (like a hackathon or conference) which the club will be known for now and in the future. </p>
<p>There is an exhaustive list of event ideas under the <strong>"Events"</strong> folder in Google Drive which can also be referenced for this purpose.</p>
<p>Highly encouraged to use ideas from general members as they are the ones driving motivation for the chapter.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="first-welcome-meeting-closing-meeting">First Welcome Meeting &amp; Closing Meeting</h3>
<p><em>Time alloted: 10-15 mins</em></p>
<p>It is suggested for the chapter to host a welcome meeting or mixer to invite back current members and welcome new members. A welcome meeting is a kick-off event to the beginning of the semester and will include information about the club, any open opportunities, club meeting times and dates, as well as any other necessary information about the club and membership.</p>
<p>A final closing meeting invites all current and past members to celebrate the achievements of the chapter, present member awards, announce any new board members or those exiting their posts, and preview events that are coming up for the following semester/year. This is also a time to invite and thank all sponsors, faculty, staff, and advisors who helped throughout the year.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="timeline-action-items-for-events">Timeline &amp; Action Items for Events</h3>
<p><em>Time alloted: 10-20 mins</em></p>
<p>Once events have been decided, use an event template (available in Google Drive under <strong>"Events"</strong> folder) to decide on a timeline for each event and use a tracking system like Trello to manage reminders for when something needs to be completed for an event and who will carry out the action item.</p>
<p>Ideally, one board member and/or general member should lead one event to lessen workload on the board.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="event-funding">Event Funding</h3>
<p><em>Time alloted: 15-20 mins</em></p>
<p>This is a time for the board to set up a budget for each event in regards to food, decorations, venue, etc. See the <strong><a href="../finances/">Finances</a></strong> section for more information on budgeting templates.</p>
<p><strong>The Finance Chair is responsible for procuring a report of available funds for the semester/year at this point in the meeting and let the board know how much is available for the semester/year (from fundraises/sponsors/Lehman CCD).</strong>*</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="sponsorship-fundraising">Sponsorship &amp; Fundraising</h3>
<p><em>Time alloted: 10-15 mins</em></p>
<p>If enough funds are not available to cover all event expenses, the board must create a plan to raise funds from fundraisers, sponsorship, or Lehman CCD funding. </p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Lehman CCD funding may not be a reliable source of funding as there is not always enough money to go around to approve a full event budget for each club. Stick to requesting less than $1,000 for CCD and ideally, only for Lehman-specific services like security, Lehman catering, etc.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="general-flyer">General Flyer</h3>
<p><em>Time alloted: 10-15 mins</em></p>
<p>The last item should be the general flyer for the semester/year. The same flyer can be carried over from prior years with any changes added. Once the flyer is finalized, the Chair should e-mail the flyer to David Charcape and request 40, 8.5 x 11 FULL COLOR copies and 20, 8.5 x 11 quarter (flyer split into 4 flyers) FULL COLOR copies.</p>
<p>The quarter flyers should be used for in-class and lecturer promotions.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue">TIP: </span> Contact the Student Life Building front-desk to post flyers for you around campus as they know all the popular bulletin boards at Lehman.</p>
<p>Send an e-mail of the general flyer to professors via gmail to promote the club in their classes.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="ghc-grace-hopper-celebration">GHC - Grace Hopper Celebration</h3>
<p><em>Time alloted: 5-10 mins</em></p>
<p>Spring semester: Make note of when applications for GHC open and work on a promotion schedule to encourage all members to apply. Include previous attendee information with the promotion schedule.</p>
<p>Fall semester: Consider holding a preparation event for GHC and a recap of the event for those attending. Work on preparing members for applying to GHC next year by incorporating project pushes, compiling a list of companies that will offer scholarships.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="elections">Elections</h3>
<p>Spring semester: Elections are held yearly and all board positions are up for re-election at the end of the semester.</p>
<p>Fall semester: Special elections apply and should be held if any board members will be leaving at the end of the semester.</p>
<p>Schedule your general meeting to discuss elections (if applicable) and schedule when the election will be held as well as when results will be released. See more information on elections in the <a href="../boardmembers/">Executive Board</a> section.</p>
