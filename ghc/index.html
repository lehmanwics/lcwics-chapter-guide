<p>The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing (GHC) is a series of conferences designed to bring the research and career interests of women in computing to the forefront. It is the <strong>world's largest gathering of women in computing</strong>. The celebration, named after computer scientist Grace Hopper, is organized by the Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology and the Association for Computing Machinery. </p>

<p>GHC scholarships open in January and are competitive. As of September 2018, 11 Lehman students have received full or partial scholarships to attend the Grace Hopper Celebration, which is an incredible accomplishment! </p>
<p>The Anita Borg Institute offers scholarships to undergraduate and graduate students to attend the conference. The scholarship includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual registration for the three-day conference</li>
<li>Hotel accommodations</li>
<li>Meal card for use at the convention center during the conference</li>
<li>Airfare</li>
<li>Travel stipend</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional companies like Twitter, Google, and Facebook sponsor students to attend the conference as well. Corporate student sponsorship varies every year. The best way to keep track of scholarships opening are by following these links:
- <a href="https://github.com/Ladies-Storm-Hackathons/GHC-Scholarships">GHC scholarships repo</a> - check the previous years to see which companies to search for
- GHC Facebook group
- <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gracehoppercelebration/">GHC Website</a> - Official scholarship</p>
<p>You can also get free registration if you apply to volunteer as a Hopper. Watch the GHC website for announcements.</p>
