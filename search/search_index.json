Social Media The chapter has the following social media accounts: Twitter | @lcwics | https://twitter.com/lcwics Instagram | @lcwics | https://instagram.com/lcwics/ Facebook | @lcwics | http://facebook.com/lcwics Authentication for Twitter and Instagram accounts are stored in LastPass . Access each account by logging into LastPass with the proper credentials. Facebook requires a current admin in the FB group to add you to the page. Managing Multiple Social Media Accounts To facitilate multi-channel posting and make life easier, install the Buffer app on your mobile device or log in online using the lcwics Twitter credentials. With Buffer , you can cross-post on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram once and the same post will appear on all channels. Posting Frequency Posting frequency is up to the Communications Chair in agreement with the executive board. Ideally, posting to announce events and post-event recaps and photos are highly suggested to keep members and followers up-to-date. Slack The chapter uses Slack chat for real-time communication with members, advisors, and executive board: lehmanwics.slack.com Ask a current board member to send you the invite link to our Slack or find it in bit.ly by accessing the credentials via LastPass . A current board member should add you to the private e-board chat and make you an admin in the workspace. Admins can manage settings, integrations, and membership for the Slack workspace. Important items can be pinned to a channel and will stay pinned forever. Make sure to remove admin privileges at the end of each semester as board members leave. Important Channels New members are automatically added to the general, opportunities, events, and _announcements channels. The channels are used as follows: general : Posting general content to share with members, news, clips, reposts from other channels, etc. opportunities : Posting internships, jobs, resources for interviewing, and anything else that could help lead to an opportunity events : Posting upcoming events (preference for women-focused, women-led events) _announcements : Posting important notifications for all members. Use @everyone to notify everyone in the workspace Website Chat The chapter uses an integrated chat bot on our website to communicate with anyone who is on our website and has questions. The service used for this chat bot is called smallchat and is an app connected to a private Slack channel called: #lcwics_site_chat The Communications chair is responsible for responding to chat conversations on the website as soon as possible. Email The chapter uses the following email services: Mailchimp Gmail | lehmanwics@gmail.com To log into Mailchimp , access the credentials via LastPass . The Gmail login is to be provided to you by current or previous board members. Mailchimp is used to send announcements, newsletters, meeting notes, and event reminders to our members. Gmail is used to communicate with members who contact us directly, respond to emails, communicate with advisors and faculty, as well as communicate with sponsors. Sharing Mailbox The Gmail inbox is currently shared amongst all board members. If a member needs to be contacted or replied to directly, the email should be prefixed with their title and name. Example: @COMM/Keri - \"Email subject here\" This allows for the correct board member to review an email. For all new emails that come into the inbox without direction, the Comm chair will respond and maintain contact until the end of the thread or a new thread begins. Once an email thread is completed or has ended and no further communication is necessary, please archive the email. Member Communication The Google Form titled \"Lehman WiCS Welcome Form\" is connected to Mailchimp service via Zapier as a zap called \"Welcome Form to MailChimp Connection\". When someone signs up using the Google Form, an action is fired off to Zapier and the new member is automatically added to Mailchimp List called \"Lehman WiCS\" . Once the new member is added, a welcome email titled 'Welcome Message' under Campaigns is sent to the user. This Welcome email should be reviewed and edited at the beginning of each semester to maintain accurate information. Do not manually add any members to this list as it could corrupt the connection. Faculty/Advisor Communication Faculty and advisors should not be emailed directly via Mailchimp. All faculty, staff, and advisors should be emailed directly from our Gmail mailbox.","title":"Communications"},{"location":"communications/#communications","text":"The chapter communicates with its members via the following channels: Social Media Slack Website chat Email Responsibility: Communications Chair maintains all communications channels.","title":"Communications"},{"location":"communications/#social-media","text":"The chapter has the following social media accounts: Twitter | @lcwics | https://twitter.com/lcwics Instagram | @lcwics | https://instagram.com/lcwics/ Facebook | @lcwics | http://facebook.com/lcwics Authentication for Twitter and Instagram accounts are stored in LastPass .

See current board members for information on where the account is held and who currently has access to withdraw funds. The club at Lehman is provided with $200 in start-up funds to be used for flyers and first-event small expenses. Use this wisely. It is suggested to keep these funds for flyers only and small incidentals. Under ACM, the chapter is required to maintain accurate and explicit records of all withdrawals and deposits. Original receipts (if available) and/or copies must be appropriately stored in the Google Drive under \"Finances\". All books and records, original documentation, and any other pertinent financial information, should be maintained by the chapter for a minimum of 4 years in order to meet federal record retention requirements. ACM Bylaw 8 [Financial Safeguards], Sections 4 and 5, and ACM Bylaw 5, Section 6 [Finance] provide detailed information regarding the rights and responsibilities of ACM chapters regarding financial matters. The following is a summary of these responsibilities: Any chapter that collects, holds or disburses funds on behalf of the Association or any of its branches must submit an annual accounting of such funds. Chapter funds will be accounted for in the Association\u2019s IRS return unless the chapter specifically desires to file a separate return with the IRS. If a chapter Secretary/Treasurer chooses to file its own return, it must provide a copy of the return to the ACM Finance Director. Failure to submit financial reports is grounds for revocation of charter as provided in the Constitution and Bylaws of the Association. Disbursements of funds for expenditures necessary for the normal operation of the chapter do not require approval. Any chapter desiring to disburse funds beyond those necessary for normal operations must obtain advance approval of the ACM Chief Operating Officer. Upon dissolution of a chapter or revocation of a chapter\u2019s charter, all assets of the chapter become the property of the Association. The only exception to this rule is in the case of certain student chapters, whose educational institutions require that such assets be transferred to them for a purpose within the contemplation of section 501 (c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Responsibility : The Finance Chair is responsible for the maintenance and collection of all financial records for the chapter. Federal Employer Identification Number As per ACM, \"ACM has a Federal Employer Identification Number (EIN), which is similar to an individual\u2019s social security number. This number is required by the IRS for purposes of filing informational or any other type of return with the IRS...The chapter\u2019s EIN should be...noted on the annual financial report filed with ACM Headquarters.\" Speak to your board members about locating EIN information. Fiscal Period \"ACM operates on a fiscal year which begins July 1st and ends June 30th . All financial books and records are maintained, and all IRS returns reported, on this fiscal calendar.\" Budgets At the beginning of each semester and as appropriate and necessary throughout the semester, the Finance chair, along with the board, must create budgets for the following semester's events up to a year in advance, taking note of the fiscal year. All budgets must include current available funds and running balance if budget is fulfilled in full. A template for budgets is included on page 51 here: http://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/chapters/chapter-in-a-box_acm-w.pdf . Deposits Donations For information on how to deposit funds from sponsors and accept donations, see the guide in Google Drive under the \"Financial\" folder. Withdrawals Expenses \"The following disbursements must be reported [and documented] if they amount to more than $600 per calendar year: awards, prizes, all types of grants, honoraria, fees for professional services, temporary employment, and if the recipient is a permanent resident of the United States. Reimbursements of actual expenses, such as travel reimbursements, need not be reported.\" All other withdrawals and expenses must be properly documented for reporting at the end of the fiscal year. In general, the chapter should aim to spend the least amount of funds in the chapter's bank account as possible to minimize difficulties with end-of-year reporting. Bank Account Withdrawals For information on how to withdraw funds from the chapter's bank account, see the guide in Google Drive under the \"Financial\" folder. Lehman Start-Up Funds Withdrawals If you would like to use the club's start-up funds provided by CCD to pay for Lehman College services, send a detailed budget to Nate and confirm receipt within one day of sending the budget. If the request is for a Lehman service, it can be fulfilled automatically. If the request is to pay for a non-Lehman service such as pizza from an outside vendor, you must submit the request at least two weeks in advance as checks are disbursed on Thursdays . Alternatively, you can request reimbursement after paying for services yourself. Receipts must be included. Budget approvals are not necessary to request withdrawals or use of start-up funds. Lehman Funds Requests (Food Other) Lehman College CCD allocates funds from Student Activity Fees to support student events on campus. Clubs are allowed to request funds for flyers, food, decorations, event security, film expenses, honorariums, and other expenses that do not include prizes or disbursement of funds to a non-authorized third party. Lehman College budget requests are only submitted once per semester at the beginning of the semester. It is extremely important that this deadline not be missed . Budget submissions are to be completed on Campus Link. A complete budget, flyer, and complete description of the event (including why it is important and why the funds are needed) is required for the event to be heard and funded. Total budget requests in excess of $1,000 for non-Lehman expenses (food not catered by Lehman, for example) should be avoided. Expenses such as Lehman catering and security officers are usually expensive and cannot be avoided. Only consider what is absolutely necessary for an event when requesting funds from CCD. An e-mail with a hearing date and deadline for budget submissions will be sent to the club and usually occurs a week into the beginning of the semester. Reimbursement Advance of Funds If a budget is not approved or Lehman funds are not disbursed in time for an event, you may be able to request reimbursement from Nate directly. You must have all receipts for reimbursement. Alternatively, you can also request an \"advance of funds\" from Nate and a maximum of $100 is allowed as an advance per person. Checks are made out every Thursday and will be made out to the person requesting the advance. Sponsorship Funds (Corporate/Support) \"For tax purposes, as well as to comply with ACM policy, it is important to distinguish between an acknowledgment of support and a paid advertisement. An acknowledgement of support should be given to anyone who has donated $250 or more. Please see an example acknowledgement of support letter in Appendix H . The chapter Treasurer must account for all sponsor money on the annual financial statement (also known as the annual report) and to the ACM Director of Finance. ACM does not prohibit chapters from accepting paid advertising, but the practice is strongly discouraged. As a general rule, ACM chapters should always be very careful to maintain the non-commercial nature of the Association, especially in a local area. \" \"The IRS requires that any chapter which collects over $1000 per year of such [advertising] income complete and to submit a 990-T return...If a chapter is required to fill the 990-T, they must submit it to the IRS on/by November 15th for the applicable tax year as it is due 5 months after ACM\u2019s fiscal year end. Any chapter considering accepting paid advertising should consult the ACM Director of Finance to understand the various tax and other issues involved.\" Whenever possible, it is suggested that sponsors donate services paid and invoiced on their end instead of paid directly to the chapter.","title":"Finances"},{"location":"finances/#finances","text":"The chapter has its own bank account to receive sponsorship donations and designate funds to specific expenses.

Lehman College budget requests are only submitted once per semester at the beginning of the semester. It is extremely important that this deadline not be missed . Budget submissions are to be completed on Campus Link. A complete budget, flyer, and complete description of the event (including why it is important and why the funds are needed) is required for the event to be heard and funded. Total budget requests in excess of $1,000 for non-Lehman expenses (food not catered by Lehman, for example) should be avoided. Expenses such as Lehman catering and security officers are usually expensive and cannot be avoided. Only consider what is absolutely necessary for an event when requesting funds from CCD. An e-mail with a hearing date and deadline for budget submissions will be sent to the club and usually occurs a week into the beginning of the semester.","title":"Lehman Funds Requests (Food &amp; Other)"},{"location":"finances/#reimbursement-advance-of-funds","text":"If a budget is not approved or Lehman funds are not disbursed in time for an event, you may be able to request reimbursement from Nate directly.

The chapter Treasurer must account for all sponsor money on the annual financial statement (also known as the annual report) and to the ACM Director of Finance. ACM does not prohibit chapters from accepting paid advertising, but the practice is strongly discouraged. As a general rule, ACM chapters should always be very careful to maintain the non-commercial nature of the Association, especially in a local area. \" \"The IRS requires that any chapter which collects over $1000 per year of such [advertising] income complete and to submit a 990-T return...If a chapter is required to fill the 990-T, they must submit it to the IRS on/by November 15th for the applicable tax year as it is due 5 months after ACM\u2019s fiscal year end.
