It is essential for the executive council to be open to the suggestions and feedback of the chapter membership, and should always be open to offers of help. Upon assuming the office, all chapter officers should contact the ACM Local Activities Coordinator to introduce him/herself, review chapter bylaws and policies and procedures, and review the events of the past year with his/her predecessors.\" Executive Board Members The chapter consists of four executive board members: Chair/President Vice-Chair/Vice President Finance Chair/Treasurer Communications Chair/Secretary Board members hold their positions for a maximum term of 1 academic year. Roles Responsibilities Chair The chapter Chairperson has the overall responsibility for developing chapter programs, for ensuring that plans and assignments are carried out, and for seeing that the chapter fulfills its obligations to the Association. The Chairperson should be familiar with the policies and procedures of the Association, with the chapter\u2019s bylaws, and with the duties of all the other chapter officers and committee chairpersons. The newly-elected Chairperson should schedule an executive committee meeting which includes the outgoing officers as well. At that time, the Chairperson may want to schedule executive council meetings for the entire year. Keep in mind the advantages of scheduling the meeting at the same time each month. Before getting too far along in the chapter\u2019s year, the Chairperson should do the following: appoint or establish nominating committee according to bylaws for next year\u2019s elections; communicate activities of the chapter to the local membership (many chapter chairpersons write a column in the chapter newsletter); set audit procedures in motion at year end for financial records turnover; and plan a budget with the chapter Treasurer, to be reviewed and approved by the entire executive council. If the chapter\u2019s area includes other local ACM groups, the Chairperson should contact the appropriate chairpersons and suggest a meeting. At the meeting, the chairpersons should discuss the possibilities for cooperative efforts, such as joint meetings, reciprocal advertising agreements, the sharing of membership lists, and planning of lecture tours. They should also discuss meeting times to ensure that one group\u2019s meetings do not conflict with meetings of other ACM chapters in the area. One of the most important duties of the chapter Chairperson is finding enthusiastic and qualified members to serve as committee chairpersons. The Chairperson should strive to bring new people into the committee structure to provide training for future chapter leaders. The job of chapter chairperson will be much more enjoyable and (much less exhausting) once responsible and reliable volunteers are found to take on various duties. It is strongly recommended that the chapter chairperson take the time at general meetings to acknowledge those chapter volunteers whose help has been valuable. This positive feedback and public recognition of good works is often just the encouragement an active volunteer needs to commit to a longer-term leadership position in the chapter in future years. Vice Chair The chapter Vice Chairperson should be prepared to assume the office of Chairperson or temporarily act in that position at any time. The Vice Chairperson should be familiar with the duties and responsibilities of the Chairperson, and of the other elected officers and committee chairpersons. The Vice Chairperson can be an integral component of the chapter\u2019s operation. In most cases, the Vice Chairperson is responsible for overseeing the activities and progress of the various committee and chapter programs. Finance Chair/Treasurer The chapter\u2019s financial management and operation are of great importance to the Association. The chapter Treasurer is responsible for the fiscal operation and reporting of the chapter, and of all committees and programs established by the chapter including sponsorships. The ongoing responsibilities of the chapter treasurer include: 1. Maintaining all chapter financial records and chapter checkbook; 2. Collecting money at meetings if applicable; 3. Filing mandatory annual financial report with headquarters; 4. Supplying appropriate budget report to the executive board of the chapter for all events; 5. Reporting financial status to chapter; 6. Maintain records of financial sponsorships; 7. Coordinating membership procedure and fee. Communications Chair/ Secretary The ongoing responsibilities of the Chapter Secretary include: 1. Informing ACM Headquarters of the names and contact information of new officers and providing headquarters with updated membership lists; 2. Sending agenda to board members for executive board meetings and recording the minutes of such meetings; 3. Handling all chapter correspondence via email and additional appropriate channels on a timely basis; 4. Maintaining chapter files for historical purposes; 5. Corresponding with headquarters regarding changes to the chapter\u2019s bylaws; 6. Sending communications via appropriate channels to members and advisors. Advisory Board Our advisory board consists of four advisors: Faculty Advisors: Eva Sofianos, Steven Fulakeza Industry Advisor: Iynna Halilou Alumnae Advisor: Leslie Gil Our advisors graciouslty offer their expertise and time to guide the chapter through any questions and concerns they have as well as provide support when possible for strategy during the semester. We invite our advisory board to all board meetings and provide updates after each meeting. Specifically, faculty advisors shall be generally responsible for the activities of the Chapter. Specifically, they help provide continuity from year to year as student leadership and personnel change; promotes good student-faculty relationships; helps maintain university standards in all activities of the Chapter; and exercises financial supervision, if necessary, by promoting prompt payment of bills and collection of dues and overseeing the settlement of all accounts in the event of dissolution of the Chapter. The faculty advisors are expected to communicate regular (at least monthly) with the chapter board and request business updates as needed. Communication The executive board for this chapter communicates regularly via Slack in our private board channel. Each board member is responsible for responding to direct communication and any questions asked of the entire board. Elections Elections are held on a yearly basis and at the end of semester (if necessary). Elections are to be hosted online via Campus Link. Elections should be held one month before the semester ends and new board members should be announced at the closing final meeting. Each member leaving their post should leave a transition guide letter detailing important information about their position, projects they were working on and left behind, as well as any other important information or advice that would be helpful for the new board member. Additionally, current board members should introduce the new board as soon as possible and in-person (if possible) to all advisors so they are aware of the transition.","title":"Executive Board"},{"location":"boardmembers/#executive-board","text":"\"The chapter\u2019s executive council is generally responsible for managing the chapter\u2019s affairs (with the exception of electing officers and amending bylaws).

Social Media The chapter has the following social media accounts: Twitter | @lcwics | https://twitter.com/lcwics Instagram | @lcwics | https://instagram.com/lcwics/ Facebook | @lcwics | http://facebook.com/lcwics Authentication for Twitter and Instagram accounts are stored in LastPass . Access each account by logging into LastPass with the proper credentials. Facebook requires a current admin in the FB group to add you to the page. Managing Multiple Social Media Accounts To facitilate multi-channel posting and make life easier, install the Buffer app on your mobile device or log in online using the lcwics Twitter credentials. With Buffer , you can cross-post on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram once and the same post will appear on all channels. Posting Frequency Posting frequency is up to the Communications Chair in agreement with the executive board. Ideally, posting to announce events and post-event recaps and photos are highly suggested to keep members and followers up-to-date. Slack The chapter uses Slack chat for real-time communication with members, advisors, and executive board: lehmanwics.slack.com Ask a current board member to send you the invite link to our Slack or find it in bit.ly by accessing the credentials via LastPass . A current board member should add you to the private e-board chat and make you an admin in the workspace. Admins can manage settings, integrations, and membership for the Slack workspace. Important items can be pinned to a channel and will stay pinned forever. Make sure to remove admin privileges at the end of each semester as board members leave. Important Channels New members are automatically added to the general, opportunities, events, and _announcements channels. The channels are used as follows: general : Posting general content to share with members, news, clips, reposts from other channels, etc. opportunities : Posting internships, jobs, resources for interviewing, and anything else that could help lead to an opportunity events : Posting upcoming events (preference for women-focused, women-led events) _announcements : Posting important notifications for all members. Use @everyone to notify everyone in the workspace Website Chat The chapter uses an integrated chat bot on our website to communicate with anyone who is on our website and has questions. The service used for this chat bot is called smallchat and is an app connected to a private Slack channel called: #lcwics_site_chat The Communications chair is responsible for responding to chat conversations on the website as soon as possible. Email The chapter uses the following email services: Mailchimp Gmail | lehmanwics@gmail.com To log into Mailchimp , access the credentials via LastPass . The Gmail login is to be provided to you by current or previous board members. Mailchimp is used to send announcements, newsletters, meeting notes, and event reminders to our members. Gmail is used to communicate with members who contact us directly, respond to emails, communicate with advisors and faculty, as well as communicate with sponsors. Sharing Mailbox The Gmail inbox is currently shared amongst all board members. If a member needs to be contacted or replied to directly, the email should be prefixed with their title and name. Example: @COMM/Keri - \"Email subject here\" This allows for the correct board member to review an email. For all new emails that come into the inbox without direction, the Comm chair will respond and maintain contact until the end of the thread or a new thread begins. Once an email thread is completed or has ended and no further communication is necessary, please archive the email. Member Communication The Google Form titled \"Lehman WiCS Welcome Form\" is connected to Mailchimp service via Zapier as a zap called \"Welcome Form to MailChimp Connection\". When someone signs up using the Google Form, an action is fired off to Zapier and the new member is automatically added to Mailchimp List called \"Lehman WiCS\" . Once the new member is added, a welcome email titled 'Welcome Message' under Campaigns is sent to the user. This Welcome email should be reviewed and edited at the beginning of each semester to maintain accurate information. Do not manually add any members to this list as it could corrupt the connection. Faculty/Advisor Communication Faculty and advisors should not be emailed directly via Mailchimp. All faculty, staff, and advisors should be emailed directly from our Gmail mailbox. Sending/Receiving Emails Gmail As explained above, the chapter uses Gmail and Mailchimp for communication. When sending an email from the lehmanwics@gmail.com mailbox, following the format below: Hello , Content Thank you, Lehman WiCS An auto-reply is turned on to direct senders appropriately. Replying to Emails Communications Chair is reponsible for replying to all general emails following the format above. For emails directed to someone on the board, that person is responsible for replying and continuing the thread. Mailchimp There are three templates in Mailchimp viewable under the \"Templates\" folder when you log in: General Events Reminders Newsletter The general template should be used for all general emails that are not part of a newsletter or event blast/event reminder.

See current board members for information on where the account is held and who currently has access to withdraw funds. The club at Lehman is provided with $200 in start-up funds to be used for flyers and first-event small expenses. Use this wisely. It is suggested to keep these funds for flyers only and small incidentals. Under ACM, the chapter is required to maintain accurate and explicit records of all withdrawals and deposits. Original receipts (if available) and/or copies must be appropriately stored in the Google Drive under \"Finances\". All books and records, original documentation, and any other pertinent financial information, should be maintained by the chapter for a minimum of 4 years in order to meet federal record retention requirements. ACM Bylaw 8 [Financial Safeguards], Sections 4 and 5, and ACM Bylaw 5, Section 6 [Finance] provide detailed information regarding the rights and responsibilities of ACM chapters regarding financial matters. The following is a summary of these responsibilities: Any chapter that collects, holds or disburses funds on behalf of the Association or any of its branches must submit an annual accounting of such funds. Chapter funds will be accounted for in the Association\u2019s IRS return unless the chapter specifically desires to file a separate return with the IRS. If a chapter Secretary/Treasurer chooses to file its own return, it must provide a copy of the return to the ACM Finance Director. Failure to submit financial reports is grounds for revocation of charter as provided in the Constitution and Bylaws of the Association. Disbursements of funds for expenditures necessary for the normal operation of the chapter do not require approval. Any chapter desiring to disburse funds beyond those necessary for normal operations must obtain advance approval of the ACM Chief Operating Officer. Upon dissolution of a chapter or revocation of a chapter\u2019s charter, all assets of the chapter become the property of the Association. The only exception to this rule is in the case of certain student chapters, whose educational institutions require that such assets be transferred to them for a purpose within the contemplation of section 501 (c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Responsibility : The Finance Chair is responsible for the maintenance and collection of all financial records for the chapter. Federal Employer Identification Number As per ACM, \"ACM has a Federal Employer Identification Number (EIN), which is similar to an individual\u2019s social security number. This number is required by the IRS for purposes of filing informational or any other type of return with the IRS...The chapter\u2019s EIN should be...noted on the annual financial report filed with ACM Headquarters.\" Speak to your board members about locating EIN information. Fiscal Period \"ACM operates on a fiscal year which begins July 1st and ends June 30th . All financial books and records are maintained, and all IRS returns reported, on this fiscal calendar.\" Budgets At the beginning of each semester and as appropriate and necessary throughout the semester, the Finance chair, along with the board, must create budgets for the following semester's events up to a year in advance, taking note of the fiscal year. All budgets must include current available funds and running balance if budget is fulfilled in full. A template for budgets is included on page 51 here: http://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/chapters/chapter-in-a-box_acm-w.pdf . Deposits Donations For information on how to deposit funds from sponsors and accept donations, see the guide in Google Drive under the \"Financial\" folder. Withdrawals Expenses \"The following disbursements must be reported [and documented] if they amount to more than $600 per calendar year: awards, prizes, all types of grants, honoraria, fees for professional services, temporary employment, and if the recipient is a permanent resident of the United States. Reimbursements of actual expenses, such as travel reimbursements, need not be reported.\" All other withdrawals and expenses must be properly documented for reporting at the end of the fiscal year. In general, the chapter should aim to spend the least amount of funds in the chapter's bank account as possible to minimize difficulties with end-of-year reporting. Bank Account Withdrawals For information on how to withdraw funds from the chapter's bank account, see the guide in Google Drive under the \"Financial\" folder. Lehman Start-Up Funds Withdrawals If you would like to use the club's start-up funds provided by CCD to pay for Lehman College services, send a detailed budget to Nate and confirm receipt within one day of sending the budget. If the request is for a Lehman service, it can be fulfilled automatically. If the request is to pay for a non-Lehman service such as pizza from an outside vendor, you must submit the request at least two weeks in advance as checks are disbursed on Thursdays . Alternatively, you can request reimbursement after paying for services yourself. Receipts must be included. Budget approvals are not necessary to request withdrawals or use of start-up funds. Lehman Funds Requests (Food Other) Lehman College CCD allocates funds from Student Activity Fees to support student events on campus. Clubs are allowed to request funds for flyers, food, decorations, event security, film expenses, honorariums, and other expenses that do not include prizes or disbursement of funds to a non-authorized third party. Lehman College budget requests are only submitted once per semester at the beginning of the semester. It is extremely important that this deadline not be missed . Budget submissions are to be completed on Campus Link. A complete budget, flyer, and complete description of the event (including why it is important and why the funds are needed) is required for the event to be heard and funded. Total budget requests in excess of $1,000 for non-Lehman expenses (food not catered by Lehman, for example) should be avoided. Expenses such as Lehman catering and security officers are usually expensive and cannot be avoided. Only consider what is absolutely necessary for an event when requesting funds from CCD. An e-mail with a hearing date and deadline for budget submissions will be sent to the club and usually occurs a week into the beginning of the semester. Reimbursement Advance of Funds If a budget is not approved or Lehman funds are not disbursed in time for an event, you may be able to request reimbursement from Nate directly. You must have all receipts for reimbursement. Alternatively, you can also request an \"advance of funds\" from Nate and a maximum of $100 is allowed as an advance per person. Checks are made out every Thursday and will be made out to the person requesting the advance. Sponsorship Funds (Corporate/Support) \"For tax purposes, as well as to comply with ACM policy, it is important to distinguish between an acknowledgment of support and a paid advertisement. An acknowledgement of support should be given to anyone who has donated $250 or more. Please see an example acknowledgement of support letter in Appendix H . The chapter Treasurer must account for all sponsor money on the annual financial statement (also known as the annual report) and to the ACM Director of Finance. ACM does not prohibit chapters from accepting paid advertising, but the practice is strongly discouraged. As a general rule, ACM chapters should always be very careful to maintain the non-commercial nature of the Association, especially in a local area. \" \"The IRS requires that any chapter which collects over $1000 per year of such [advertising] income complete and to submit a 990-T return...If a chapter is required to fill the 990-T, they must submit it to the IRS on/by November 15th for the applicable tax year as it is due 5 months after ACM\u2019s fiscal year end.

This meeting will serve as a time for the board, advisors, and general members (if invited) to work together and create a plan for meetings, mixers, events, and fundraising for the semester/year. The Communications Chair and Vice-Chair should work together prior to this meeting to create an agenda that includes the following items: Theme for the semester/year (optional but will help guide what type of events to host) Goals for the semester/year General meeting dates/times/location Board meeting dates/times/location Events for the semester/year First welcome meeting Closing final meeting details Timeline and action items for events General funding needed for events Sponsorship/fundraising General flyer GHC - Grace Hopper Celebration Elections This is a general list and can be revised based on the needs of the chapter. Fall Semester : Use for preparing for GHC attendance, interview prep, getting resumes in order, workshops/panel events Spring Semester : Use for applying to GHC (application reviews), hackathon, socials A planning meeting usually runs between 3-5 hours. Please plan accordingly. Your agenda will help immensely. Agenda Breakdown Goals Time alloted: 10-15 mins 1-3 goals per semester is sufficient. Ideally, 2-3 goals if planning is for the entire year. Goals should be measurable so they can be easily tracked. Poor goal : Gain more members Good goal : Gain at least 10 active members Goals will also guide you in creating events for the semester/year in order to meet these goals. Make sure to put something a system in place to easily track your goals throughout the semester. Choosing General Meeting Dates Time alloted: 5-10 mins Meetings are generally run every Wednesday from 4pm - 5pm. Add holidays and days off from the CUNY calendar onto the chapter's Gmail calendar and work around them to create a calendar of meeting dates. This information can also be added to the general meeting flyer. For more information on general meetings, go to the meetings section in this guide. Choosing Board Meeting Dates Time alloted: 5-10 mins Work with your board members to see which dates/times work best for board meetings. Generally, an hour before the club's meeting time is preferred and during club hours as most students will not have class during this time. Add these dates to the Gmail calendar. For more information on board meetings, go to the meetings section in this guide. Events for the Semester/Year Time alloted: 30-60 mins This is an important item that should not be skipped. Take time to think through events, mixers, panels, hackathons, workshops, and Tech Treks that will be valuable to your members and lead to a successful semester. Also considering volunteering events, social mixers, and cool-off events to bring members together and hang out. You are required by Student Life to have 4 events a semester so you must have a minimum of 4 events (of any type) scheduled. * Review the most successful events in the past (see Google Drive) and have a flagship event (like a hackathon or conference) which the club will be known for now and in the future. There is an exhaustive list of event ideas under the \"Events\" folder in Google Drive which can also be referenced for this purpose. Highly encouraged to use ideas from general members as they are the ones driving motivation for the chapter. First Welcome Meeting Closing Meeting Time alloted: 10-15 mins It is suggested for the chapter to host a welcome meeting or mixer to invite back current members and welcome new members. A welcome meeting is a kick-off event to the beginning of the semester and will include information about the club, any open opportunities, club meeting times and dates, as well as any other necessary information about the club and membership. A final closing meeting invites all current and past members to celebrate the achievements of the chapter, present member awards, announce any new board members or those exiting their posts, and preview events that are coming up for the following semester/year. This is also a time to invite and thank all sponsors, faculty, staff, and advisors who helped throughout the year. Timeline Action Items for Events Time alloted: 10-20 mins Once events have been decided, use an event template (available in Google Drive under \"Events\" folder) to decide on a timeline for each event and use a tracking system like Trello to manage reminders for when something needs to be completed for an event and who will carry out the action item. Ideally, one board member and/or general member should lead one event to lessen workload on the board. Event Funding Time alloted: 15-20 mins This is a time for the board to set up a budget for each event in regards to food, decorations, venue, etc. See the Finances section for more information on budgeting templates. The Finance Chair is responsible for procuring a report of available funds for the semester/year at this point in the meeting and let the board know how much is available for the semester/year (from fundraises/sponsors/Lehman CCD). * Sponsorship Fundraising Time alloted: 10-15 mins If enough funds are not available to cover all event expenses, the board must create a plan to raise funds from fundraisers, sponsorship, or Lehman CCD funding. NOTE: Lehman CCD funding may not be a reliable source of funding as there is not always enough money to go around to approve a full event budget for each club. Stick to requesting less than $1,000 for CCD and ideally, only for Lehman-specific services like security, Lehman catering, etc. General Flyer Time alloted: 10-15 mins The last item should be the general flyer for the semester/year. The same flyer can be carried over from prior years with any changes added. Once the flyer is finalized, the Chair should e-mail the flyer to David Charcape and request 40, 8.5 x 11 FULL COLOR copies and 20, 8.5 x 11 quarter (flyer split into 4 flyers) FULL COLOR copies. The quarter flyers should be used for in-class and lecturer promotions. TIP: Contact the Student Life Building front-desk to post flyers for you around campus as they know all the popular bulletin boards at Lehman. Send an e-mail of the general flyer to professors via gmail to promote the club in their classes. GHC - Grace Hopper Celebration Time alloted: 5-10 mins Spring semester: Make note of when applications for GHC open and work on a promotion schedule to encourage all members to apply. Include previous attendee information with the promotion schedule. Fall semester: Consider holding a preparation event for GHC and a recap of the event for those attending. Work on preparing members for applying to GHC next year by incorporating project pushes, compiling a list of companies that will offer scholarships. Elections Spring semester: Elections are held yearly and all board positions are up for re-election at the end of the semester. Fall semester: Special elections apply and should be held if any board members will be leaving at the end of the semester.
