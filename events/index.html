                <p>Events for the chapter are stored under the <strong>"Events"</strong> folder in Google Drive. A guide for activities to consider every year for events is also available in that folder.</p>
<p><strong>An event template is available in Google Drive under "Events" folder to facilitate the process of creating an event.</strong></p>
<p>Events must be pre-approved and previously agreed upon by the board. *</p>
<p><em>It is suggested that the board collectively comes up with an event title, flyer, and description <strong>before</strong> submitting an event to make the process quicker. This is usually done during <a href="../semesterplanning/">semester/yearly planning</a>.</em></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="submitting-events"><span style="color: orange"><em>Submitting Events</em></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Events must be submitted at least a month in advance to secure the desired location.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>AFTER YOU SUBMIT AN EVENT, GO TO MARGARET IN STUDENT LIFE &amp; CONFIRM THE ROOM RIGHT AWAY. Avoid things falling through the cracks and not having a room in the end.</strong></p>

<hr />
<h2 id="catering"><span style="color: orange"><em>Catering</em></span></h2>
<p>Event submissions do not include food requests (unless you are using your own money, in which case, skip this and order the food you want). Food requests are made at the beginning of the semester via budget requests. See the <a href="../finances/">Finances</a> section for more information on creating budgets and requesting funds.</p>
<p>Catering pamphlets for Lehman College are on Campus Link and the Google Drive.</p>
<p>If using sponsorship funds for food instead, confirm the food request <strong>a week</strong> before the event and again <strong>3 hours</strong> before the event. See the <a href="../finances/">Finances</a> section for more information on keeping proper financial records for food requests.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="decorations-other-expenses"><span style="color: orange"><em>Decorations &amp; Other Expenses</em></span></h2>
<p>Event submissions do not include funding for decorations or other expenses. See the <a href="../finances/">Finances</a> section for more information on creating budgets and requesting funds.</p>
<p>Confirm shipment or delivery is en route, <strong>two</strong> weeks before the event.</p>
<p>If using sponsorship funds for these expenses instead, see the <a href="../finances/">Finances</a> section for more information on keeping appropriate records.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="flyers"><span style="color: orange"><em>Flyers</em></span></h2>
<p>Flyers should be disbursed around campus at least 2 weeks in advance, with 3-4 weeks being optimal. Use <a href="../services/#canva">Canva</a> to create your flyer and save to the Google Drive.</p>
<p>Send the flyer to David for printing (color and/or black &amp; white copies). It is suggested to have at least 40, 8.5 x 11 FULL COLOR copies and 20, 8.5 x 11 quarter (flyer split into 4 flyers) FULL COLOR copies.</p>
<p>The quarter flyers should be used for in-class and lecturer promotions.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue">TIP: </span> Contact the Student Life Building front-desk to post flyers for you around campus as they know all the popular bulletin boards at Lehman.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="promotion"><span style="color: orange"><em>Promotion</em></span></h2>
<p>There are several channels available for event promotion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mailchimp</li>
<li>Slack</li>
<li>College chairs/faculty</li>
<li>Meetings</li>
<li>In-Class Promotion</li>
</ul>
<p>Use Mailchimp to send out meeting announcements at least 2-3 weeks before the event via newsletter. Send a reminder on the day-of in the morning (schedule the email).</p>
<p>Announce the event on Slack as soon as possible and add the event to the LC WiCS Calendar. Post a reminder a day before and a couple of hours before the event on Slack. Once an event is added to our Calendar, a notification immediately goes to Slack.</p>
<p>Send an email a week before the event to CUNY college department chairs and Lehman faculty politely asking to share details with their students. <strong>DO NOT USE mailchimp for this. It's rude to mass email them since they did not subscribe to our list</strong>. Email them one-by-one from YOUR personal email and CC LehmanWics Gmail. Include the flyer, date, time, and location.</p>
<p>Announce and remind members during meetings that the event is coming up.</p>
<p>Email professors asking for permission to promote in their classes and/or share the event flyer with their classes. For bigger turnout, choose lower-level CMP courses and higher-level electives. Consider cross-promoting and/or co-sponsoring with NSBE/SHPE and/or ALPFA or other CUNY clubs for larger turnout.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="event-confirmation"><span style="color: orange"><em>Event Confirmation</em></span></h2>
<p><strong>AFTER YOU SUBMIT AN EVENT, GO TO MARGARET IN STUDENT LIFE &amp; CONFIRM THE ROOM RIGHT AWAY. Avoid things falling through the cracks and not having a room in the end.</strong></p>
<p>An event submission is <strong>not</strong> confirmed until Margaret confirms the date, time, and room location. Keep in touch with Margaret until location is confirmed and re-confirm the event two weeks before the date of the event.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="av-equipment"><span style="color: orange"><em>A/V Equipment</em></span></h2>
<p>You have two options:
1. Get A/V from Student Life Building
2. Get A/V from Media Services (Migdio Dominguez)</p>
<p>Option 1 is best for low-key student events where high-quality equipment is not needed. As of now, the SLB A/V is outdated and may not be optimal for most events. Request it anyway in the event form as a backup.</p>
<p>Option 2 is your go-to option. They have high-quality equipment that works with Lehman setup. This equipment MUST be well taken care of and returned without damage. Contact Migdio Dominguez on Media Services by email (use your own email and CC Lehman WiCS or it might be marked as spam) and then call/go directly to them to confirm.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="special-requests"><span style="color: orange"><em>Special Requests</em></span></h2>
<p>See our Google Drive under the <strong>Events</strong> folder for Special Requests.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="event-locations"><span style="color: orange"><em>Event Locations</em></span></h2>
<p>See our Google Drive under the <strong>Events</strong> folder for possible locations to host events around campus and who to contact.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="day-of-event-structure"><span style="color: orange"><em>Day-Of Event Structure</em></span></h2>
<p>Arrive at least <span style="color: red">two</span> hours before the scheduled event time to wrangle any needed equipment, confirm the location is open, set up food, seating, and decorations. </p>
<p>Have a sign-up sheet ready and available to sign-in attendees. </p>
<p><strong>Follow the event template to have a run-down of what needs to be completed before, during, and after the event.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Events should follow the same general format:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A welcoming statement, usually by the chapter Chair, to welcome attendees and to talk briefly about the chapter </li>
<li>Introduction of the speaker(s) [if applicable]</li>
<li>Introduce the talk</li>
<li>Begin event</li>
<li>A question and answer period </li>
<li>a closing statement to thank the speaker(s) for the program and announce the next meeting </li>
</ol>
<p>A thank you note and small gift should be sent to speakers after the event to thank them for their contribution.</p>
<p>Remember to take photos and do a recap!</p>
<p>After each event, the Communications Chair should add up any points for members and send an email to those not in our mailing list.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="troubleshooting"><span style="color: orange"><em>Troubleshooting</em></span></h2>
<p>Margaret is the person to contact if there are any issues on the day-of the event. Nate may also be able to help if he is available.</p>
